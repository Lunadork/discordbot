# discordbot
## basic discordbot for Zoey's server.

## v1 -- code this Friday/Saturday.

Will listen to input and react to !meme / !help and also !leaguenoobers

- !meme : fetch random meme and post => 10 memes.  Will be stored in an array initially.  Though may do a fetch to giphy based on terms, i.e. !meme anime will search giphy for anime and return the first result.

- !leaguenoobers : will add the person to the leaguenoobers group

- !help : Will list commands

## v2 

Will work as a music bot as well.

## v3 

Will do some postgres stuff to store data and be a bit more flexy.  Fetch requests to an app on heroku.

Will add !addmeme command - will take a link to an image, then store the link to that image in the memes table.

## v4

Will have an auth system so only users with a username and password can add memes.

## v5 

Whatever else comes up / seems fun!
